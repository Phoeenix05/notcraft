# NotCraft

This is totally not a copy of **minecraft**. This project is not meant to replicate **minecraft** completely
but just the world generation, block placing and braking and maybe mobs, no real gameplay. 

I only want to see if I can actually make this and how complicated I can make it *(which is probably no a good idea)*.

I'm also trying to experiment with derive macros in this project. So if there are derive macros in places where they 
make little sense that is why.
